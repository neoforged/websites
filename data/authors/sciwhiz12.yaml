bio: |
    sciwhiz12 is a member of the Triage Team, a maintainer of the official Forge documentation site, and a generally known
    fellow in the Forge development spaces (or at least, he hopes to be).
    He is also an administrator for the Forge Community Wiki, and one of the members of the ParchmentMC mappings team.
    On the side, he likes writing documentation and other such stuff, and sometimes easily gets sidetracked by some neat or 
    interesting idea.
