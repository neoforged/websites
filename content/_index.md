# Using NeoForge for mod development

## If you don't have a current mod project

1. Go to the [MDK list], select the one for the version you're interested in, and click `Use This Template` to create a copy under your personal GitHub account.
2. Clone the MDK locally, and get started! Our [Documentation] and the [Modding Wiki] are great places to learn more.

## If you have an existing mod project
Refer to the [MDK list] for examples of how to update your build script to use NeoForge.
