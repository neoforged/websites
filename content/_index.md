# Using NeoForge for mod development

## If you don't have a current mod project
1. Go to the [Mod Generator page] and enter the settings for your new mod.
2. Download the generated mod, unzip it, and get started! Our [Documentation] and the [Modding Wiki] are great places to learn more.

## If you have an existing mod project
Refer to the [MDK list] for examples of how to update your build script to use NeoForge.
