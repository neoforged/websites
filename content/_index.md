# Using NeoForge for mod development

## If you don't have a current mod project

1. Go to [The MDK] and click `Use This Template` to create a copy in your personal GitHub space.
2. Clone this project locally, and get started! Our [Documentation] and the [Modding Wiki] are great places to learn more.

## If you have an existing mod project
Refer to [The MDK] for an example of how to update your build script to use NeoForge.
