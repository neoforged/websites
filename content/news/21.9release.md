The first beta release of NeoForge 21.9 for Minecraft 1.21.9 is now available: `21.9.0-beta`.
<!-- This post covers a small subset of the vanilla changes, to get you started with the update! -->

## FML changes

## Transfer rework

## Selected vanilla changes?

## Finding out what needs to be migrated
A good strategy to migrate your mod is to have a working Minecraft 1.21.8 workspace alongside your in-progress Minecraft 1.21.9 workspace.
This allows you to quickly find out how to update specific pieces of code.
The workflow is as follows:
1. Find a function call that doesn't compile anymore in 1.21.9.
2. Find the same function call in the 1.21.8 workspace that still compiles.
3. Right click the function call, and go to a vanilla usage of the method. _Note_: In IntelliJ, this requires the Minecraft sources to be attached, and the scope for the search needs to be set to `All Places`!
4. Go to the same vanilla usage in 1.21.8, and compare to see how vanilla updated their code.
5. In many cases it is enough to make the same change to your code.

This can also be applied on a larger scale than a function call, for example to learn how block entity rendering changed between 1.21.8 and 1.21.9.

## Porting Primer
A porting primer covering a lot more of Minecraft's changes is available [here](https://github.com/neoforged/.github/blob/main/primers/1.21.9/index.md) (courtesy of `@ChampionAsh5357`).
<!-- TODO: use permalink if the primer is not merged in time -->

Happy porting!
