# Disclaimer
The transfer rework is a work in progress. Likewise this blog post is also a work in progress. It is also not sure when the transfer rework will be ready, so take the 22.0 in the url with a grain of salt.

In the meanwhile, please have a look at the [pull request](https://github.com/neoforged/NeoForge/pull/1115) for the transfer rework. You can try it out locally, and give feedback. We are also discussing these changes in a Discord thread of the NeoForge Discord server, in the `#brainstorming` forum.

# Introduction
The release of NeoForge TODO VERSION comes with a fundamental redesign of the item, fluid and energy transfer systems, contributed by CodexAdrian and Soaryn, with the goal of fixing many issues that were found in the previous iteration after years of usage.

This change affects the `IItemHandler`, `IFluidHandler`, `IFluidHandlerItem` and `IEnergyStorage` interfaces, the corresponding capabilities, and all the supporting classes.
The new system will be introduced in the first part of this post.

We are aware that this is a large breaking change, and have taken steps to soften the transition, as will be outlined below in the second part of this post.

# The new transfer APIs
Here are the replacement for the old APIs:
- `IItemHandler`: replaced by `IResourceHandler<ItemResource>`.
- `IFluidHandler`: replaced by `IResourceHandler<FluidResource>`.
- `IFluidHandlerItem`: replaced by `IResourceHandler<FluidResource>` + a suitable `IItemContext` passed to the capability query.
- `IEnergyStorage`: replaced by `IEnergyHandler`.

## Resources
Resources are objects that represent _what_ is being transferred.
For example, an `ItemResource` consists of an `Item` as well as an immutable component map.
Resources allows separating _what_ is being transferred and _how much_ is being transferred,
as will be shown below.

Resources have the following properties:
- **Immutability**: resources are immutable objects.
- **No amount**: resources do not contain information about how much is being transferred.
- **Overrides for equals and hashCode**: resources are compared with `equals`, and can be hashed with `hashCode`. Combined with their immutability, this makes them great as map keys.
- **Implement IResource**: all resources implement `IResource`, which provides the `isEmpty()` function.

Currently, NeoForge provides two resource implementations: `ItemResource` and `FluidResource`,
which work in very similar ways.
Here are some usage examples of `ItemResource`:
```java
// Construction of a resource from an item:
ItemResource resource = ItemResource.of(Items.DIAMOND);

// Conversion of a stack to a resource:
ItemStack stack = /* ... */;
ItemResource resource = ItemResource.of(stack);

// Conversion of a resource to a stack:
ItemStack stack = resource.toStack();
ItemStack stack10 = resource.toStack(10); // optional amount

// Comparison of resources:
resource1.equals(resource2)

// Usage in map keys:
Object2IntMap<ItemResource> amounts = new OpenObject2IntHashMap<>();
amounts.put(ItemResource.of(Items.APPLE), 10); // 10 apples
```

NeoForge also provides a `ResourceStack`, which is a simple immutable wrapper around a resource and an amount.
TODO conversion methods between itemstack/fluidstack and resourcestack
TODO currently there is also a mutable version of the stacks

## Resource handlers
The core interface for resource transfer is `IResourceHandler<T extends IResource>`, exposing the following functionality:
- Handler metadata querying:
  - `size`
  - `supportsInsertion`
  - `supportsExtraction`
  - `isValid`
  - `getCapacity` and the optional long version `getCapacityAsLong`
- Handler contents querying:
  - `getResource`
  - `getAmount` and the optional long version `getAmountAsLong`
- Handler modifications:
  - `insert`
  - `extract`

Note that the `insert` and `extract` methods come in both a version working on a specific slot of the handler,
as well as a version that works over the entire handler.
The version that works over the entire handler should be preferred if possible as it is more convenient and lets the handler potentially implement the operation much more effectively.

The `insert` and `extract` methods have the same signature. Here is for example the slotted `insert` method:
```java
// Returns: how much was inserted
int insert(int index, T resource, int maxAmount, TransactionContext transaction);
```
Here is a breakdown:
- The `int index` parameter indifies the slot of the handler, and should be between `0` (inclusive) and `size()` (exclusive).
- The `T resource` parameter indentifies which resource is being inserted.
- The `int maxAmount` parameter indicates how much of the resource is being inserted.
- The `TransactionContext transaction` parameter is the transaction for this operation. (see below)
- The method returns **how much was accepted**, i.e. how much was inserted for `insert` and how much was extracted for `extract`. If the resource cannot be inserted/extracted, the method should return `0`.

## Transactions
The new transfer APIs are built around the concept of transactions, which contain multiple individual operations and can be either executed or cancelled at once.
You can think of transactions as video game checkpoints: 
- Opening a transaction creates a new checkpoint.
- Committing a transaction validates the change, discarding the checkpoint.
- Aborting a transaction restores the state to the previous checkpoint.

Transactions are opened with `Transaction.open(@Nullable parent)` - or with the `Transaction.openRoot()` shorthand if there is no parent, always using a try-with-resources statement.
The transaction is confirmed using the `.commit()` method - if the transaction was not committed by the end of the `try` block, it will be aborted automatically.

Here is an example of inserting exactly 10 apples in a resource handler:
```java
boolean insert10Apples(IResourceHandler<ItemResource> handler) {
    // Open a new transaction:
    try (Transaction tx = Transaction.openRoot()) {
        // Insert up to 10 apples
        if (handler.insert(ItemResource.of(Items.APPLE), 10, tx) == 10) {
            // If 10 apples were inserted (return value 10), then commit the transaction.
            tx.commit();
            return true;
        }
        return false;
        // The transaction was not committed, so here the insertion will be reverted.
    }
}
```

Here is another example, converting 16 coal items into 1 diamond:
```java
// Extracts 16 coal from slot 0 and inserts 1 diamond into slot 1. Only if both succeed.
// Returns true if both operations succeeded, false otherwise.
boolean coalToDiamonds(IResourceHandler<ItemResource> handler, boolean simulate) {
    var coal = ItemResource.of(Items.COAL);
    var diamond = ItemResource.of(Items.DIAMOND);

    // Open transaction:
    try (var tx = Transaction.openRoot()) {
        if (handler.extract(0, coal, 16, tx) != 16) {
            // If we can't extract 16 coal, abort immediately.
            // This will revert the extraction of the coal.
            return false;
        }
        if (handler.insert(1, diamond, 1, tx) != 1) {
            // If we can't insert 1 diamond, abort immediately.
            // This will also revert the extraction of the 16 coal items.
            return false;
        }
        // By now we know that the operation is a success, so we will return true.
        // If we are just "simulating" the operation, we don't commit to revert the change anyway.
        if (!simulate) {
            tx.commit();
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

This is implemented internally by saving state snapshots, and reverting to them if necessary.
The bulk of the work is handled by the `SnapshotJournal` class, which needs to be subclassed for transaction support.
In most cases, using the provided implementation templates and wrappers, means that no additional work is needed to support transactions.

## Energy
TODO currently the PR has slotted energy

Since energy does not have a concept of resources, it has its own simpler interface: `IEnergyHandler`,
with the following methods:
- Handler metadata querying:
  - `supportsInsertion`
  - `supportsExtraction`
  - `getCapacity` and the optional long version `getCapacityAsLong`
- Handler contents querying:
  - `getAmount` and the optional long version `getAmountAsLong`
- Handler modifications:
  - `insert`
  - `extract`

The differences compared to the old `IEnergyStorage` are: transaction support, method renames, and optional long getters.

# How to migrate
We are aware that many modders are dealing with changes in the transfer handling at the same time as many other changes, and would rather not rewrite their mod entirely.

Due to the transactional nature of the new transfer API, it is not possible to provide a wrapper that turns any `IItemHandler` into an `IResourceHanler<ItemResource>`, and similarly for the other resource types.
The capabilities for the old handlers have also been replaced by capabilities for the new handlers.
This means that mods who **register capability providers** will need to migrate, however read on.

However, the reverse is possible, and provided by NeoForge:
- `IItemHandler.of(handler)` will wrap a `IResourceHandler<ItemResource>` as a an `IItemHandler`.
- `IFluidHandler.of(handler)` will turn a `IResourceHandler<FluidResource>` as a `IFluidHandler`.
- `IEnergyStorage.of(handler)` will turn an `IEnergyHandler` into an `IEnergyStorage`.

While the capabilities for the old handlers have been replaced, the old handlers themselves have been deprecated for removal but left mostly **unchanged**.
Combined with the above adapters, this means that mods who **use the capabilities** will need minimal changes to make their mod work again.


This allows the following migration strategy.

## Step 1: Making your mod compile again
As long as your mod doesn't compile, it is impossible to test any change, making upgrading much more difficult. So the first step is make your mod compile again.

### 1.1: Comment any capability provider registration
This means that your mod's containers, tanks, etc... won't be recognized as item/fluid/energy handlers for the time being. However, you will be able to test using mods that have migrated already.

### 1.2: Migrate any old capability query
Thanks to the wrappers, it is very easy to migrate capability queries.
You will find some examples below.

For **block capabilities**:
```diff
- IItemHandler handler = level.getCapability(Capabilities.ItemHandler.BLOCK, pos, side);
+ IResourceHandler<ItemResource> newHandler = level.getCapability(Capabilities.ItemHandler.BLOCK, pos, side);
+ IItemHandler handler = newHandler == null ? null : IItemHandler.of(newHandler);

  handler.insertItem(...);
  // ...
```
All the following code can remain unchanged for now.

For **entity capabilities**, this is very similar:
```diff
- IFluidHandler handler = entity.getCapability(Capabilities.FluidHandler.ENTITY, side);
+ IResourceHandler<FluidResource> newHandler = entity.getCapability(Capabilities.FluidHandler.ENTITY, side);
+ IFluidHandler handler = newHandler == null ? null : IFluidHandler.of(newHandler);

  handler.fill(...);
  // ...
```

For **item capabilities**, the migration is a bit more complicated because of the item contexts.
For item handlers and energy storages, you can use `StackItemContext` which will apply modifications to the stack directly:
```diff
  ItemStack stack = ...;
- IEnergyStorage storage = stack.getCapability(Capabilities.EnergyStorage.ITEM);
+ IEnergyHandler handler = new StackItemContext(stack).getCapability(Capabilities.EnergyHandler.ITEM);
+ IEnergyStorage storage = handler == null ? null : IEnergyStorage.of(handler);

  storage.receive(...);
  // ...
```
For fluid handlers, the migration from `IFluidHandlerItem` is a bit trickier.
It is simpler to use the `FluidUtil.getFluidHandler(stack)` method,
which was updated to wrap a new handler into the old `IFluidHandlerItem`:
```diff
  ItemStack stack = ...;
- IFluidHandlerItem handler = stack.getCapability(Capabilities.FluidStorage.ITEM);
+ IFluidHandlerItem handler = FluidUtil.getFluidHandler(stack).orElse(null);

  handler.drain(...);
  // ...
```

### 1.3: Run and test your mod!
With these changes, your mod should compile and run again.
Of course, your own containers will not be recognized because of step 1.1,
but you can test your capability usage against vanilla containers and other methods that were updated.
Some ideas:
- For item transfer: chests, shulker box items, minecarts, ...
- For fluid transfer: cauldrons, buckets, ...

## Step 2: Migrating your capability providers
The next step is to migrate your capability provider implementations,
such that you are able to register them to the new capabilities.
In most cases, it should not be necessary to implement the new handlers directly, thanks to the expanded set of provided templates.

This step can hopefully be done incrementally for your mod.
Once all the capability providers have been restored, your mod should be fully functional again.
You can either stop there for the time being, or continue with step 3 to finish the migration.

## Step 3: Moving away from the deprecated classes
Your mod is able to both query the new capabilities, as well as register providers for them.
However, it is still full of classes that are deprecated for removal, especially if you used the strategy from step 1.1.
Over time, you should look into migrating away from usage of the old capabilities, such that you are prepared for their removal in a future NeoForge update.
**The deprecated classes will be removed in a future NeoForge version cycle, i.e. NeoForge 22.2 or later.**

# Final words
We hope that the transition to this new API will not be too painful, and that the end result will make writing transfer code more intuitive and pleasant, as well as enable new original features (in particular, using transactions).

As usual, we are happy to provide help with the migration on Discord. It is also quite likely that there will be bugs in the new API give its size; should you find any, please don't hesitate to let us know via GitHub. Requests for missing features are of course also welcome.

# Acknowledgements
