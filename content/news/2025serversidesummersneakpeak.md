Hello everyone! Get your modder thinking caps on! NeoForge is partnering with CreeperHost and CurseForge to bring you a brand new competition!

# Serverside Summer!

The focus is on **mods that run on servers without needing to be on the client** and must be **using an Open Source license**. The competition will **start on June 1st** and **end on July 31st**. Modders will need to create mods and submit them during that time frame. 

**Prizes are $150 for the top 30 mods!** Thatâ€™s right, the total prize pool is $4500 due to gracious donations from CreeperHost and CurseForge! *(Teams that made a mod will have the money divided among the team members)*

More info on the rules, submission forms, and more will be announced on June 1st. Clear out a spot in your calendar for this contest if you wish to join! 

Any Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license from [this list is allowed](https://opensource.org/licenses) for the contest. For a guide into what an Open-Source license actually is and which ones are commonly used, check out [the Open-Source License blog post here](https://neoforged.net/personal/telepathicgrunt/open-source-licenses/)!
