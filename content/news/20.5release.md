_This post is still a draft._ <!-- TODO remove this line -->

The first beta release of NeoForge for Minecraft 1.20.5, NeoForge 20.5.TODO-beta is now released!
Please try it out, play with it, develop with it, and give us feedback!
**We are not stable yet**, so expect a few breaking changes in the coming weeks.
If you are a contributor, now is a great time to start working on your Pull Requests.

For players, you can grab the latest installer directly from https://neoforged.net/.

There are a few important breaking changes in NeoForge,
but must of the technical changes come from Minecraft 1.20.5 itself.
