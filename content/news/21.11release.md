The first beta release of NeoForge 21.11 for Minecraft 1.21.11 is now available: `21.11.0-beta`. Let's see what has changed.

## Future removal of obfuscation
Mojang has [recently announced](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition) that they will soon be removing obfuscation, **starting from the next series of snapshots**.
Unobfuscated versions of Minecraft have already been made available to help mod loaders update their tooling, but they are not accessible by launchers out of the box. NeoForge 21.11 thus **continues** to be built on top of an **obfuscated Minecraft**.

We have already started to update our tooling to support unobfuscated versions, such that we will be ready for the next series of snapshots.
For NeoForge modders, this mostly means that the official parameter names used by the developers of Minecraft should become available in the future, but not much will otherwise change since we already removed obfuscation of mods from our toolchain two years ago.

Fabric however was affected more severely. If you are interested, you can read more on this [in their blog post](https://fabricmc.net/2025/10/31/obfuscation.html). Notably, they are finally discontinuing Yarn and embracing Mojang's official names.

## Renaming of `ResourceLocation` to `Identifier`
`ResourceLocation` was renamed to `Identifier`.

This change will likely affect many mods, but should be fairly mechanical, especially with find-and-replace.
Here are some migration examples:

```diff
- ResourceLocation key = BuiltInRegistries.ITEM.getKey(...);
+ Identifier key = BuiltInRegistries.ITEM.getKey(...);

- register(ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("mymod", "thing"), ...);
+ register(Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("mymod", "thing"), ...);
```

!!! note
    Yarn, Fabric's set of mappings, famously used `Identifier` whereas Mojang used `ResourceLocation`.
    We will let you speculate as to whether this rename is a tribute to Yarn,
    a way to make Fabric modders not regret switching to official names,
    or whether Mojang simply found it to be a better name.

## JSpecify nullability annotations
Following many other Java projects (e.g. Gradle, Spring Boot, ...),
Minecraft and NeoForge switched to [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev/docs/start-here/)'s nullability annotations.

The convention is that nullable parameters, fields, etc... get a `@Nullable` annotation,
whereas non-annotated variables are assumed to be non-null.
Minecraft and NeoForge add `@NullMarked` to all their packages via `package-info.java` files to make IDEs aware of that.

Migrating from `javax.annotation.Nullable` to `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` is fairly straightforward,
however pay attention to these two points:
1. JSpecify are exclusively "type use", meaning that they can only be put in specific places.
    For example, `@Nullable Map.Entry` will **not** compile.
    Instead, use `Map.@Nullable Entry`.
2. For arrays, `@Nullable` can either be placed in front of the element type, or between the element type and the `[]`. These have different meanings:
    - `@Nullable Object[]`: a non-null array of nullable `Object`s.
    - `Object @Nullable[]`: a nullable array of non-null `Object`s.
    - `@Nullable Object @Nullable[]`: a nullable array of nullable `Object`s.

JSpecify currently only covers nullability, so NeoForge is still using and making available JetBrains' annotations,
for example for the `@ApiStatus` annotations.

## Baked quad changes
TODO

TODO: rendertype building changes; vanilla types moved to RenderTypes

TODO: entities and renderers and other minor package moves

<!-- TODO update stuff below -->

## Finding out what needs to be migrated
A good strategy to migrate your mod is to have a working Minecraft 1.21.10 workspace alongside your in-progress Minecraft 1.21.11 workspace.
This allows you to quickly find out how to update specific pieces of code.
The workflow is as follows:
1. Find a function call that doesn't compile anymore in 1.21.11.
2. Find the same function call in the 1.21.10 workspace that still compiles.
3. Right click the function call, and go to a vanilla usage of the method. _Note_: In IntelliJ, this requires the Minecraft sources to be attached, and the scope for the search needs to be set to `All Places`!
4. Go to the same vanilla usage in 1.21.11, and compare to see how vanilla updated their code.
5. In many cases it is enough to make the same change to your code.

This can also be applied on a larger scale than a function call, for example to learn how baked quads changed between 1.21.10 and 1.21.11.

## Porting Primer

A porting primer covering a lot more of Minecraft's changes is available [here](https://github.com/neoforged/.github/blob/main/primers/1.21.11/index.md) (courtesy of `@ChampionAsh5357`).

Happy porting!
